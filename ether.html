        <h2>intro</h2>
        <p>In March, 2022, I started discussing and researching an NFT project.  I'm writing this sentence on April 9.  So far I have minted several test 
            tokens first from the command line and then from the web.</p>

        <h2>creating and deploying contracts, and minting from the command line</h2>

        <p>My client will use OpenSea as a secondary market.  The secondary market has nothing to do with me as the contract 
            writer; at least, that is my conclusion so far.  However, I didn't understand that weeks ago, so I used 
            <a href='https://docs.opensea.io/docs/getting-started-1'>one of OpenSea's tutorials</a>.  What I mainly wound up using was 
            <a href='https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/nft-tutorial/tree/part_four'>their "part 4" code</a>.  
                I'll mention this <a href='https://docs.opensea.io/docs/1-structuring-your-smart-contract'>other OpenSea doc link</a>, but I haven't looked 
            hard at it yet.  </p>

        <p>OpenSea's examples were quite good.  The only major criticism I have is that the test ETH faucet they recommended (for the Rinkeby Testnet) did not 
            work and wasted my time trying to get it to work.  The one they sent me to forced one to post publicly on social media.  The ones that 
            worked did not.  In hindsight, a hint that it wasn't working was that the previous transactions displayed were from "2 days ago."  
        </p>

        <h3>working test ETH faucet (Rinkeby Testnet)</h3>
        <p><a href='https://rinkebyfaucet.com/'>RinkebyFaucet</a> works without an account to receive 0.1 ETH per day or 0.5 with an Alchemy 
            account.  You'll 
            probably want an Alchemy account anyhow, as recommended in OpeaSea's tutorial.  It took 1.5 or 
            2 minutes to process without an account, or without being logged in.
        </p>

        <p>I originally used "MyCrypto" in March.  It's not working now.  I mention it only because it did get me started.</p>

        <h3>ETH needed to test / sample account history</h3>

        <p>Contract creation cost 0.0034 ETH with a creation time of several minutes, so that first 0.01 limit from MyCrypto  was a problem.  See 
            <a href='https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/txs?a=0x9BEb87E50Dbb3f1356C9B8d72A5F08C794d3b95f'>my 
            test account history</a> on EtherScan.  Note that it includes my test contracts.
         </p>
            
             
        <h3>tutorial command line notes</h3>

        <p>I noted that an EtherScan key takes 5 - 10 minutes after creation to become valid.      </p>

# part 1 version, I think
npx hardhat deploy

    <h2>The web - Connect to MetaMask, client-size JavaScript "hello world" notes</h2>

    <p>Two examples: A <a href='hello_world_ETH_tx.html'>generic ETH transaction / sending eth</a>, and then 
        <a href='hello_world_mint_NFT.html'>mint an NFT</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>starting from <a href='https://docs.metamask.io/guide/sending-transactions.html'>MetaMask docs</a></li>
        <li>the original had gas settings</li>
        <li>0x11c37937e080000 === 0.08 ETH in the newer (2nd) example. Thankfully, lower-case works, too.  </li>
        <li>0x2D79883D20000 === 0.0008 ETH in the older (1st) example.  
            See <a href='https://lab.miguelmota.com/ethereum-unit-converter/example/'>ETH - WEI - hex calculator</a>.  A WEI is 
                    10<sup>-18</sup> Ether.  Hex is needed for the examples I adapted.</li>
        
        <li>see below regarding the minting "data" param</li>
        <li>I do not yet fully understand how the client-side JS examples relate to 
            <a href='https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.1/web3-eth.html#sendtransaction'>web3 in the more general sense</a></li>
        <li>I only got one or two useful points from the following only because it's not the path I plan to take, and it's much more complicated 
            than I need, but it did get me started, so I'll mention the 
            <a href='https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-sdks/how-to-build-a-one-click-sign-in-using-metamask-with-php-s-laravel'>QuickNode article</a>
        </li>

        <li>Similar to the above, I didn't use this much, but it helped me along a bit: 
            <a href='https://forum.moralis.io/t/one-click-mint-nft-button-erc1155-721-boilerplate/2617/5'>Moralis</a> library (?) discussion</li>

                        <li>I have not tried this yet, but this looks potential more efficient than what I have done: 
                    <a href='https://codepen.io/BboyAkers/embed/PoqQNpw'>"BboyAkers" Ether button</a></li>
        
    </ul>


    <section>
    <h3>the minting "data" param</h3>
    
    <p>First, note that if the code is verified as noted in the tutorial and with the command above, you can mint on EtherScan from the 
        contract, such as <a href='https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8ca86d22241c3458441e286fa0062023988c1e61#writeContract'>my second 
            test contract</a> that I used to any degree.  Put 0.08 as the payable amount and whatever address you want to receive the token 
            in the other param.
    </p>
    
    <p>If you do it that way, you can see the "data" param in MetaMask.  That data param is the ABI / application binary interface.  In this case, 
        it's the "mintTo" function's signature--params, types, etc.--in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode / binary code.  You need that 
        param in the client-side (web) JavaScript, as shown in my example.  
      </p>
      
      <p>I'm sure there are other ways to derive the param, and I've seen reference to them, but that works for now.  Hopefully I will update 
          this when I find a way that I can use before the contract is deployed.
