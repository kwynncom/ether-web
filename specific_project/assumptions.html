        <h1>NFT project settings / assumptions</h1>
        
        <p>If you'll excuse the pun, I'm assuming that the assumptions will change, as of late April, 2022.  I'm listing what needs to be 
            filled in as far as possible before go day.  </p>
        
        <p>I'm going to number this like 1985 BASIC lines.</p>
        
        <ol>
            
            <li value='150'>There will be a limit of 2,222 tokens. (Note to self: look in the Etherscan verification and make sure that's 
                2,222 rather than 2,222,000.  That will be fixed in the next GitHub commit to 
                <a href='https://github.com/kwynncom/nft'>the repo</a>.  For the record, 2222_000 means 2+ million as above.  Update: the 
                repo has been updated.)</li>
            
            <li value='160'>The mint price will be 0.08 ETH (eight hundredths or 8/100 ETH).  That's $247 with an ETH price of $2,838 (as of 
            2022/04/26 ca 11:02pm EDT / New York time).</li>
            
            <li value='200'>I will need the medium-length name of the token / collection.  You showed me a name to the effect of "HolyHeroes."  
            I don't think this name can or should have spaces, but this is a situation where I am unclear on what is social convention and 
            what is syntax.  Far be it for me to burden you with technical details.  If you don't have an idea based on convention, I 
            will look into the limitations.</li>
            
            <li value='210'>And then there is the token ticker name like "HOLY" or "ETH."  Again, I'm not sure what's convention and 
                what's syntax.  Even I know enough to observe that at least by social convention they are 4 - 5 letters at most, and I'm not 
                sure about 5.
            </li>
            
            <li value='220'>I need to know when the medium name and ticker name can be public, such as visible on the public GitHub repo, 
                my (this) web site, etc.  
                
            </li>
            
            <li value='230'>For the above, I need to see if duplicates are enforced / disallowed.  That's probably on me as a technical issue.
               
            </li>
            
            <li value='300'>There will be roughly 6 people who can do one free mint.  I'm calling this the "freelist."  (Other limitations 
            of the freelist are below.)</li>
            
            <li value='310'>The exact number in the freelist does not matter.  What matters is the assumption that I can keep track of it 
                "by hand" in a small text file.  If the number is going to go above 15 or so, I need to know.  More limitations below.</li>
            
            <li value='350'>There will be a whitelist or early sales list.  More limits below.</li>
            
            <li value='360'>For sake of filling in a number for now, the whitelist addresses can mint 2 tokens.  (The likely alternative is 1.  
                The GitHub version has 2 because 2 seems more meaningful to test.)</li>
            
            <li value='370'>The whitelist will be roughly 800 addresses.  In this case, even the order of magnitude is not important because I'll 
                obviously have to automate the process.</li>
            
            <li value='400'>Sales to the general public, for sake of filling in a number, will begin on June 3, 2022 at 9pm EDT (New York time)</li>
            
            <li value='410'>Whitelist and free mints will begin exactly 24 hours before the public sale.</li>
            
            <li value='420'>The free mint people must claim their free mint during the whitelist/free mint period</li>
            
            <li value='500'>The whitelist and freelist will be frozen / fixed / complete / non-changing / hard-coded (hard-code-able) several days 
                before the whitelist / presale date</li>
            
            <li value='600'>The "reveal" or access to the images themselves will happen roughly 3 - 5 days after the public sale begins.</li>
            
            <li value='700'>Resales will be on OpenSea.  (I need to test arbitrary metadata / images  on OpenSea.)
            </li>
            
            <li value='710'>Beyond making sure the metadata will work and that resales will work on OpenSea, I'm reasonably sure 
            OpenSea is not involved in the contract itself, but I need to check this assumption.</li>
            
            <li value='720'>As a purely technical issue for me, I need to decide if the metadata base URL can be changed after deployment.  At least, I'm 
            assuming that's a technical issue, but we can get into that somewhat later.</li>
            
            <li value='2000'>For a minor point, the web buttons for "whitelist mint," "free mint," and "public / standard mint" will 
            be separate buttons.</li>
        </ol>
