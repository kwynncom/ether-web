    <h1>NFT project status report #1: April 30, 2022</h1>
    
    <p>OUTSTANDING HIGH-PRIORITY ISSUE: Use of OpenSea is looking questionable.  Maybe their testnet has been broken for roughly 2 days, but their testnet just 
        does not seem to want to load images.  If their testnet doesn't work; why should we assume their live system will?  Is an alternative to 
        OpenSea an option?  Once I recover from frustration (see below), I may finally install Discord and get on their channel or do something 
        along those lines, but I already consider this a big problem.
    </p>
    
    <h2>overall status</h2>
    <p>Whitelist and freelist with time restrictions and minting limits appear to work.  Metadata is working fine as I further document
        below, so I am running out of reasons to think the OpenSea issues are my fault.  
   </p>
   <p>At this rate, I may stop for at least a day or two.  I am very, very frustrated with OpenSea.

   <h2>the metadata / OpenSea problem</h2>
   
   <p>Go to <a href='https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x09789fc3bca6cab64a6f3d6b86defa360710b10c#readContract'>my latest contract</a> and run the 
       tokenURI function by individual entering numbers 1 - 4, as 4 different clicks.  I am almost certain this does not require test ETH gas.
       The metadata in the 
       sense of the JSON file will show up like this: <a href='https://kwynn.com/t/22/04/eth/mds/4'>https://kwynn.com/t/22/04/eth/mds/4</a> . 
       Clicking the <a href='https://kwynn.com/t/22/04/eth/mds/4.png'>"image" url</a> should bring up an image.  OpenSea is reading the images:

       <p>I have specific reason to believe that the "python requests" are OpenSea.  Then it seems lots of other people start reading it.  There are 
           more already, and I'm writing this at 18:06.  For the moment, I'm pretty much out of ideas on what more to try.  
           
       </p>
       
       <p>Then look at <a href='https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/nfttutorial-h4tjedv6nw'>OpenSea at my contract</a>.  Even if you click on 
           the <a href='https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/0x09789fc3bca6cab64a6f3d6b86defa360710b10c/4'>individual images</a>, it just will not show 
           the *($@(!! image.  
           
       </p>
       
       <p>The loopback address (127.0.0.1) is where I use a proxy "trick" to rewrite and keep the same URL from the user's perspective.  The rewrite request is 
           done internally and then handed to the external user.  
           
           Although I had 
           already confirmed that OpenSea was following 302 redirects and retrieving the image just fine.

   <h2>my doings</h2>
   
   <p>I've only been using <a href='https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x9BEb87E50Dbb3f1356C9B8d72A5F08C794d3b95f'>one address</a> 
       ( 0x9BEb87E50Dbb3f1356C9B8d72A5F08C794d3b95f ) on the Rinkeby Ether testnet.  <a href='https://github.com/kwynncom/nft'>My code</a> is in GitHub.  
       Most of the contracts are verified on Etherscan, meaning you can read the code there, too.  
   </p>
    
   <p>I may add more commentary later, but I should post this for now.
